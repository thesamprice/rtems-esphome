# One fully expanded linker script, generated here.
#
# The BSP's linkcmds ends with "INCLUDE linkcmds.base", and the WiFi sections
# have to be placed inside that file's SECTIONS block, above its
# .unexpected_sections catch-all.  Three shortcuts were tried and each failed
# quietly, which is why this does it the explicit way:
#
#   -T fragment, alongside -qrtems's own -T linkcmds: ld reads the fragment
#     first, before the MEMORY block exists, and warns "region RAM_CODE not
#     declared" for every placement.
#   -dT fragment: ld ignores a default script whenever any -T is given, so it
#     does nothing at all and the only symptom is the original overflow.
#   ld's INSERT BEFORE: augments the *default* script, so it cannot name a
#     section defined in the same file -- "`.unexpected_sections' not found for
#     insert".
#   a spliced linkcmds.base on ld's -L path: ld resolves INCLUDE relative to
#     the including script's directory, so the installed one still wins.
#
# The splice point is above .bss rather than above the .unexpected_sections
# catch-all at the end.  Anywhere above the catch-all claims the input sections
# correctly, but .work (NOLOAD) sizes itself to whatever is left of RAM, so a
# .wifi_dram placed after it overflows RAM by exactly its own 496 bytes.
#
# So: expand the INCLUDE, splice the placement in, and write the result as a
# file named linkcmds in its own directory which is put AHEAD of the BSP's on
# gcc's -B path.  -qrtems resolves its own "-T linkcmds" through that search,
# so it finds this one, and everything else -- start.o, crtbegin, the archive
# group -- still comes from the BSP directory behind it.
#
# -qrtems has to stay.  Hand-rolling its options instead (explicit archive
# group, no -qrtems) boots into the same 0xABCD0002 root-mount failure even
# with the BSP's own unmodified linkcmds, so that route is a dead end that
# looks like a linker-script bug and is not one.
